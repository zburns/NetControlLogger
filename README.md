ARES Net Control Logger

This was software I wrote years ago for logging contacts in an Amateur Radio Emergency Services (ARES) situation.

Unfortunately, lots of idiots come out of the woodwork when running a true scenario (Tornados and other quickly changing Weather phenomenon) so I don't do Net Control anymore.
