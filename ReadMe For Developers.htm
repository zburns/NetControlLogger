            Source Code is in C# (Version 2.0 - ECMA Specificatiosn)</p>
        <p>
            External Component Dependancies by Developer Express (mostly for Grid and Lookup 
            controls)</p>
        <p>
            Developed and committed using Visual Studio 2010 SP1</p>
        <p>
            Tried to keep &quot;worst-case scenario&quot; while developing.&nbsp; So no reliance on 
            Internet connectivity, Microsoft Office Products, etc.&nbsp; If you&#39;re in a 
            disaster scenario and just have a netbook, this program will work.</p>

            CodePlex Login Information is username/password....snd/username_cp and password 
            (codeplex can act a little funny sometimes)</p>
        <p>
            Why did I choose CodePlex vs. SourceForge, GoogleCode, etc, etc.&nbsp; I was 
            originally looking for a cross-platform source control system such as Subversion 
            or Git that I could house on GoDaddy or some other shared server.&nbsp; I always 
            hate having a third party kludge and the version control system (Team Foundation 
            Server) works very well for Visual Studio integration.&nbsp; Since it is a 
            Windows product and probably always will be, I chose CodePlex because I needed 
            it to seemlessly interact with Visual Studio, I could web-browse the source 
            code, and use Subverson or Mercurial if need be.&nbsp; No other public source 
            control server seemed to handle Team Foundation Server connectivity.&nbsp; Plus, 
            I needed a stable company to back the source control store.&nbsp; That only left 
            SourceForge, Google, and CodePlex (Microsoft).</p>
